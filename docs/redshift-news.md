v1.12 (2018-05-20)
------------------
- Change location providers to allow updates. GeoClue and CoreLocation now
  provide continuous location updates.
- Allow time-based configuration i.e. setting the redness effect based on time
  of day instead of based on the elevation of the sun. See the man page for
  more information.
- Now looks for the configuration file in `~/.config/redshift/redshift.conf`
  (or `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/redshift/redshift.conf`) if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is
  set. The old location at `~/.config/redshift.conf` is deprecated but
  still searched as a fall back.
- Run hooks when enabling/disabling Redshift.
- Default temperatures changed to 6500K during daytime and 4500K during night.
- With `randr`, allow multiple but not all CRTCs to be redshifted.
- Removes deprecated original GeoClue location provider (use GeoClue 2
  instead).
- The option for enabling the short fade between color effects is now called
  `fade` instead of `transition` in the configuration file. The term transition
  caused a lot of confusion about what this option does (the old option still
  works but is deprecated).
- The `preserve` option is enabled by default for `vidmode`, `randr`, Windows
  (`w32gdi`) and macOS (`quartz`). The option is now controlled by the `-P`
  command line option.
- Work around issue where Windows adjustments sometimes fail.
- Install AppArmor profile.
- quartz: Fix incorrect use of display identifier.
- Various bug fixes and updated translations.

v1.11 (2016-01-02)
------------------
- Add option `preserve` for gamma adjustment methods (`randr`, `vidmode`,
  `quartz`, `w32gdi`) to apply redness on top of current gamma correction.
- Fix #158: Add redshift.desktop file to resolve an issue where Geoclue2
  would not allow redshift to obtain the current location (Laurent Bigonville)
- Fix #263: Make sure that the child process is terminated when redshift-gtk
  exits.
- Fix #284: A sample configuation file has been added to the distribution
  tarball.
- Fix warning message in redshift-gtk that is some cases caused redshift-gtk
  to fail (#271) (Christian Stadelmann, Javier Cantero)
- Fix #174: Use nanosleep() for sleeping to avoid high CPU load on platforms
  (NetBSD, ...) with limitations in usleep() (Piotr Meyer)
- Various updates to man page and translations.
